### Description

Spell check any text chat window you have open, (Ex: look at screenshot). works with almost all windows. By just clicking on a windows text field it gets the hwnd and gets the text from it. If you right click on a highlighted word it can be added or it can give you suggestions. I put in a 1024 letter limit so it would not slow down while your typing, you can change it to be what ever you want in the code.

I included with this a 280.000 words file if you dont need so many words you can get a smaller word file.

Known Issues:

Doesnt work with trillian and MSN messanger. If you know how to get text from thosue programs please post the code.
